=head1 NAME

  BundCookieAckAndData.seq - COOKIE-ACK chunk is received bundled with DATA chunk as the first chunk

=head1 PURPOSE

  To check that if COOKIE-ACK received bundled with data chunks as first
  chunk then the endpoint should accept this message.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin html
<PRE>
  <A HREF="./BundCookieAckAndData.seq">./BundCookieAckAndData.seq</A> [-tooloption ...] -pkt <A HREF="./BundCookieAckAndData.def">./BundCookieAckAndData.def</A>
    -tooloption : v6eval tool option
  See Also: <A HREF="../common/STD_PKT_COMMON.def">../common/STD_PKT_COMMON.def</A>
            <A HREF="../common/SCTP_COMMON.def">../common/SCTP_COMMON.def</A>
</PRE>

=end html

=head1 PRE-TEST CONDITION

  Association not established between endpoint A and B. Also arrange the
  data in endpoint A such that COOKIE-ACK chunk bundled with DATA chunk
  is sent to endpoint B.

=head1 TEST PROCEDURE

  Endpoint A                           Endpoint B                ULP
  (ESTABLISHED)                        (ESTABLISHED)

                                                   <-----    Associate
                <-----------------      INIT

  INIT-ACK      ----------------->

                <-----------------      COOKIE-ECHO

  COOKIE-ACK    ----------------->
  (data chunk multiplexed)
                <-----------------      SACK

  TEST DESCRIPTION:

  1. Attempt to initiate an association from endpoint B to endpoint A.
     Send COOKIE-ACK message from endpoint A bundled with data chunks 
     with COOKIE-ACK as the first chunk. In response to COOKIE-ECHO.
  2. Check A: COOKIE-ACK is accepted and association is established. 
  3. Check B: SACK is received at endpoint A. 

=head1 NOTE

  None

=head1 REFERENCE

  RFC 4960

  6.10.  Bundling

    An endpoint bundles chunks by simply including multiple chunks in one
    outbound SCTP packet.  The total size of the resultant IP datagram,

    including the SCTP packet and IP headers, MUST be less that or equal
    to the current Path MTU.

    If its peer endpoint is multi-homed, the sending endpoint shall
    choose a size no larger than the latest MTU of the current primary
    path.

    When bundling control chunks with DATA chunks, an endpoint MUST place
    control chunks first in the outbound SCTP packet.  The transmitter
    MUST transmit DATA chunks within an SCTP packet in increasing order
    of TSN.

    Note: Since control chunks must be placed first in a packet and since
    DATA chunks must be transmitted before SHUTDOWN or SHUTDOWN ACK
    chunks, DATA chunks cannot be bundled with SHUTDOWN or SHUTDOWN ACK
    chunks.

    Partial chunks MUST NOT be placed in an SCTP packet.  A partial chunk
    is a chunk that is not completely contained in the SCTP packet; i.e.,
    the SCTP packet is too short to contain all the bytes of the chunk as
    indicated by the chunk length.

    An endpoint MUST process received chunks in their order in the
    packet.  The receiver uses the Chunk Length field to determine the
    end of a chunk and beginning of the next chunk taking account of the
    fact that all chunks end on a 4-byte boundary.  If the receiver
    detects a partial chunk, it MUST drop the chunk.

    An endpoint MUST NOT bundle INIT, INIT ACK, or SHUTDOWN COMPLETE with
    any other chunks.
